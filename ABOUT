Problem: The owner wanted a hard copy data sheet for every lease customer we had. It was easy to view this information within the CRM, however it was important to him that we had a physical book where we kept our notes which could be summoned and reviewed upon request.

Solution: Grab the important information that we can export out of the CRM into individual excel sheets all within the same workbook. By also pre-designing the sheet layout, we can strategically position information, and leave required whitespace, so that when you print the entire workbook, everything comes out beautiful.
